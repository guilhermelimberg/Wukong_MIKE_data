# Wukong_MIKE_data
All information regarding stars from the Wukong stellar stream from spectroscopy with MIKE/Magellan.

abund_data folder: final abundances for each star ([smhr](https://github.com/andycasey/smhr)/[LESSPayne](https://github.com/alexji/LESSPayne) format)
line_data folder: line-by-line abundances for each star
reduced_spectra: yes, the MIKE spectra reduced

Wukong_ALL_MIKEsample.csv: a file with almost all relevant information for the Wukong stars coming from Gaia, spectroscopic surveys (H3 or APOGEE), and our own analysis. 

wuk_master_abund_table.csv: all abundance information for all stars obtained through our analysis in a more comprehensible way and easy to deal with than smhr/LESSPayne standard. A code to generate this kinds of tables from smhr/LESSPayne outputs is available at [this repo](https://github.com/guilhermelimberg/abund-tables).

Na_NLTE_corrections.csv: line-by-line NLTE corrections to the sodium abundances from [Lind+2011](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011A%26A...528A.103L/abstract).
